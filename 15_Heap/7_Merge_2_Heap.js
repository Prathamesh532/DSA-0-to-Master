/**
 * Problem Description:
 * --------------------
 * Given two Max-Heaps (heap1 and heap2) represented as arrays,
 * merge them into a single Max-Heap and return the merged heap.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Merge the two heaps into a single array.
 * 2. Rebuild the Max-Heap from the merged array using the heapify process.
 *
 * Example:
 * heap1 = [10, 5, 6, 2]
 * heap2 = [12, 7, 9]
 *
 * Merged Heap = [12, 10, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6]
 *
 * --------------------
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Merging two heaps: O(n1 + n2)   (concatenation)
 * - Building heap (heapify from bottom-up): O(n1 + n2)
 *   â†’ Overall: O(n1 + n2)
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - Extra array for merged heap: O(n1 + n2)
