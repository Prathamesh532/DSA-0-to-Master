- Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and Hashing techniques

### 2. **Linked Lists**

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### 3. **Stacks and Queues**

- Stack Implementation (Array & Linked List)
- Queue Implementation (Array & Linked List)

### 4. **Recursion**

- Base case and recursive case
- Backtracking

### 5. **Trees**

- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Tree Traversal Techniques (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

### 6. **Hashing**

- HashMap / HashTable Implementation

### 7. **Greedy Algorithms**

- Greedy Approach and Optimal Solutions

### 8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

- Memoization and Tabulation Techniques

### 9. **Graph Algorithms**

## üí° Projects

To apply the knowledge gained in DSA, I am also working on small projects:

1. **Project 1: Task Scheduler**

   - Description: Uses priority queues and greedy algorithms to manage scheduling tasks efficiently.
   - Status: In Progress

2. **Project 2: Pathfinding Visualizer**

   - Description: Visualizes graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
   - Status: To Be Started

3. **Project 3: Memory Game**
   - Description: A simple game built using dynamic programming to track scores and game states.
   - Status: To Be Started

## üéØ Goals

- Master all basic DSA concepts and techniques.
- Solve 400+ DSA problems across various platforms.
- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for coding interviews by practicing mock problems regularly.
