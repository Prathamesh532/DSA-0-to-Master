/*

Build an Array With Stack Operations:
A target array (strictly increasing, values from 1 to n)
An integer n, representing the upper bound of a number stream [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
You can use only two stack operations:
Push: add the next number from the stream to the stack
Pop: remove the top element from the stack

Your task: Simulate stack operations so that at the end, the stack looks exactly like target, from bottom to top, and no extra operations beyond whatâ€™s needed.

Example:
Input: target = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 5
Output: ["Push", "Push", "Push", "Push", "Push"]

Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
