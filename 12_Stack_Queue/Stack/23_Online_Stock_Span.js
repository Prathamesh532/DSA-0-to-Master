Online Stock Span:- 
The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock and 
we need to calculate the span of the stock's price for all n days. 
The span Si of the stock's price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days for which the price of the 
stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the previous day. If the price of the stock on the current day 
is greater than the price of the stock on the previous day, then the span is 1. For example, if the stock price on day 0 is 100, 
on day 1 is 80, on day 2 is 60, on day 3 is 70, on day 4 is 60, on day 5 is 75 and on day 6 is 85, then the stock span for day 0 is 1, 
for day 1 is 1, for day 2 is 1, for day 3 is 2, for day 4 is 1, for day 5 is 4 and for day 6 is 6.

Example:-
Input: prices = [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
